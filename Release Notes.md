Hey everyone! I've been incredibly busy with other work lately, but since I received a few emails about some fixes that are honestly quite overdue, I took some time to dive in and get them sorted. Mostly a bunch of crashes… here's some deets on the more juicy items:

- New(-ish) iPads without home buttons should now have proper support now. There's really no reasonable excuse for why this hadn't happened yet, but at least it's done now? Right?

- There was a small issue causing huge problems on first launch, where the app would crash because it needed to update a back button that wasn't loaded up yet. Took care of it, no need to worry yourself anymore.

- The guide file wasn't being correctly included in the shipped app, which meant that if you tried to open the guide without internet, there'd be hell to pay. No one wants that, so I fixed it to make sure it doesn't happen again.

If you're having issues or want to make a suggestion, I always try to be available to help out… even if Progressions isn't something I'm able to work on full-time. Toss an email my way via support@pgns.co or follow @progressionsapp on Twitter.
