It's been a long time coming, but I've given Progressions a little bit of love (I'll be real, needing to update the litany of App Store screenshots was holding me back). I've fixed some bugs and returned a feature that was removed when I rebuilt the app: iOS got dark mode, so in return, I give you light mode!

- When I rebuilt the app without including the choice between light and dark themes, I got a lot more email than I would've expected, so I felt like I needed to make it right by returning the feature. Choose between themes in Settings, or use the System option to dynamically change based on the Dark Mode option in iOS 13.

- There was a small issue causing huge problems on first launch, where the app would crash because it needed to update a back button that wasn't loaded up yet. Took care of it, no need to worry yourself any longer.

- The guide file wasn't being correctly included in the shipped app, which meant that if you tried to open the guide without internet, there'd be hell to pay. No one wants that, so I fixed it to make sure it doesn't happen again.

If you want to let me know about any issues, I'll be happy to hear from you. Either tweet at @progressionsapp, or send an email to support@pgns.co, and I'll do what I can to help out.

Until next time!
