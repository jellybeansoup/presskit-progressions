The last release introduced a couple of awkward bugs that ranged from being slightly annoying to making the app unusable. Because I know how frustrating these things can be, I put a rush on getting an update out the door to resolve the issues I know about. If there's anything elseâ€¦ please let me know, and I'll do what I can.

- I inadvertently discovered that there are people still using Progressions on iOS 13 when the last release introduced an issue that caused them to experience a black screen upon loading the app. The good news is that I was able to fix it, the bad news is that Progressions' support for iOS 13 is not long for this world, so it might be worth updating to the latest iOS anyway.

- Progressions' ability to track the system dark mode setting and serve up the appropriate theme was on its last legs due to system-level changes, so when I switched over to scene-based UI architecture in the last release, I basically ripped the carpet out from underneath it and broke the thing. A couple of adjustments and it's back up and running again. Phew!

- Another issue that showed up in the recent update was the fact that Progressions couldn't process external files or links, which isn't awesome when that's how a lot of stuff gets shared around. I'm working on better solutions for this, but I also dug in and sorted out the problem because I don't like leaving things broken. It bothers me.

Thanks for using Progressions! Once again, if you need help or have suggestions, toss an email to support@pgns.co or tweet @progressionsapp, and I'll do what I can!

Until next time!
