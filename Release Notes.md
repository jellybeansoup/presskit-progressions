A small but important update todayâ€¦ well, small on the surface, but rather huge under the hood. Definitely important, either way.

- A while back, a user discovered that some less common chords weren't transposing correctly, setting me on a path that I'd been considering for a long while: ripping out and re-implementing the core logic for finding chords in plain text. It was no small task, but has definitely made my life infinitely easier, improved the range of chords it can handle, and significantly reduced false positives. I haven't even gotten to the part where I'm making full use of the new capabilities for rendering charts yet, and I'm already impressed, so I hope you are too!

- The search bar in the chart list has been looking more and more out-of-date as iOS versions progressed, so I updated it to be more at home with search bars in other parts of iOS.

Thanks for using Progressions! If you need help or have suggestions, toss an email to support@pgns.co or tweet @progressionsapp, and I'll do what I can!

Until next time!
