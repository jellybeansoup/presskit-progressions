- Over Christmas, it came to my attention that there's an issue with editing charts where they won't be saved properly, so they retain the edits while the app stays alive, and then get lost on relaunch. It came down to a piece of code that was supposed to check if the chart existed in the database already, but it was returning a false negative. It should work now.
