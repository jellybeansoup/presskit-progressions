This is the super biggest update I've ever done. It contains lots of tweaks and oft-requested features and makes some steps towards a more customisable experience.

Sadly, this version also removes iCloud support, due to several crucial issues. Transferring your data is still possible by using the backup feature, which has had several improvements made to it. If you have any concerns, please get in contact via the support email: progressions@jellystyle.com
