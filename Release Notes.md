I've been hard at work this week fixing up a bug that I know a number of users have been hitting still, where the "All Charts" list was showing up blank. I promised many of you I'd try and get an update out to fix the issue by the end of the week, and I think I might have JUST made it. It was a tricky bug, but I think I finally nailed it.

Thanks to everyone who helped me figure this out by emailing in. Y'all deserve some of the credit, too!

I also head that people were still struggling with how to open backup files now that Dropbox is no longer integrated into the app, so I made some sweet enhancements on that front.

Here's the low down:

- Non-English characters in chart titles were still futzing things up left and right, so I went deeper into the code to resolve the issue, and introduced some failsafe measures to ensure no more blank lists going forward.

- Editing a chart's title and changing its order within the All Charts list could cause the wrong chart to be displayed once the edit screen was dismissed. A quick check in the code, and now it should all work as expected. No more getting lost!

- The screens for backups and imports in settings scored a new "Browse" option, which allows you to select a file to import from other apps that support Document Pickers, like Dropbox, iCloud and more.

- On iOS 11, the Files app can now display files from Progression's document folder, which allows you to move files in to be opened from within Progressions later. This is more or less the same as the old File Sharing method, but much more convenient.

If you need help, or want to let me know how things are going with the update, you can shoot me an email as support@progressions.co, or tweet @progressionsapp. I'd love to hear from you, and I'm ready to help out if you need me!

Until next time!
