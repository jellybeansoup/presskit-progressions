I had a few people write in to tell me about the stuff that they've been dealing with in Progressions recently, so here's an update dedicated to them. I really appreciate it when I hear from people using the app, even if it's because of a bug.

- Despite being a fairly rudimentary thing, the ability to rename sets has been something that Progressions has lacked for a long while. Too long. So when I got asked to add the feature again recently, I took the opportunity to dig in and provide a way to do it: tap the edit button on the list, and then edit the name right there in the navigation bar. No muss, no fuss.

- If transposition involved changing a natural chord to a flat or a sharp, bass notes were getting updated twice. The number of characters in the chart's text would change, and the way that the code for transposing charts to know where it up to would get out of alignment. The good news is that someone spotted it, let me know, and I dug in to find the cause and rooted it out. Problem solved.

- I've also seen a bunch of crashes happening during transposition, so I went through it and did what I could to stop the crashes from happening by making sure it didn't try to mess with strings outside of their bounds. Between this and the last fix, transposition should be back to being rock solid againâ€¦ I just hope saying so doesn't jinx it.

Thanks for using Progressions! I love to hear from you all, so if you need help or have suggestions, toss an email to support@pgns.co or tweet @progressionsapp, and I'll do what I can!

Until next time!
