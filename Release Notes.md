I'm sure that most of you thought Progressions was out for the count. It's definitely true that it's been a long time, but don't give up hope just yet! Progressions v2.0 is here, with a small (but significant!) update to bring it in line with all the changes that iOS has seen over the past few years.

- The old look was getting pretty... well, OLD. This new version is redesigned to fit in with the rest of iOS, losing the dated textures and going with a darker, sleeker look that works great just as great on stage as it does in your living room.

- Improved support for additional screen sizes! Whether you use an iPad Pro, or one of the larger iPhones, this update should ensure maximum use of the screen to make things a whole lot easier for you!

- Support for iOS's built-in sharing features has been improved, allowing more freedom with how you share your charts. PDFs, text files and links are all able to be shared with the built in share sheet, making it easier to get charts from one place to another.

- Backup files should a little more solid now, as I resolved a bug that could cause charts to be missed when creating them.

- The backlight slider now taps into the system control (which didn't exist the last time I updated the app, DANG) to dim the screen.

- Dropbox integration has been removed, since the same behaviour can be achieved by using Export > Open In from the Dropbox app itself.

- A whole bunch of small fixes and updates under the hood to help make this release the best yet (90% of the app has been rewritten and updated at this point).

Stay tuned, because there'll be more updates in the near future! In the mean time, if you have suggestions or need assistance, you can email me at support@pgns.co, or hit up @progressionsapp on Twitter. I'd love to hear from you!
