Hello again! Just popping in with a much-requested feature addition, and a quality of life improvement for yours truly. 

- Every few months, someone emails me to ask about support for page turners, and because I've never been able to track down any details on how they work, I've never managed to give a satisfactory response. Until now. I spent some time significantly improving Progressions' keyboard navigation, and so with that comes support for page turners that work by sending keyboard shortcuts. Sorry I'm so late to this particular party, everyone.

- I recently made changes to the way I collect crashes analytics in my other app (GIFwrapped), and given it's incredible success both in how useful the new services are, and how much more privacy-focused they allow me to be, I've made the change in Progressions as well. This update comes with the requisite changes to the Progressions' privacy policy, so be sure to check in on that if you're curious.

Thanks so much for using Progressions! If you have anything you'd like to mention to me, the best thing you can do is reach out: send an email to support@pgns.co or hit up @progressionsapp on Twitter. I want Progressions to be the best it can be, so I'm always happy to hear from you!
